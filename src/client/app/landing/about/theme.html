                            <p>The time demands wakefulness, because our salvation is nearer-the night is far spent, and the day is at hand. All signs foretell that the moment of Christ’s return is almost here, and our redemption is nearer. Before the day breaks, the night becomes darker- before delivery, labour pains intensifies. </p>

                            <p>We are the children of light and the day, we are not of the night or darkness (Eph. 5:14, 1 Thess. 5:4-7).</p>

                            <p>The Lord’s coming is unpredictable (1 Thess. 5:2)- No one can be very specific about the exact day, month or year the Lord would come to harvest the earth, why then should be sleeping and the day overtake us as a thief?</p>

                            <p>Jesus will come unexpectedly (1 Thess. 5:3)- In the times when everyone proclaims peace and safety, when everything seems to be going well, then will come the sudden destruction. “Wake the watchmen up, and, with them, bear the message in words of power. Cry aloud, spare not, lift up thy voice like a trumpet, and show My people their transgression, and the house of Jacob their sins. The increase of your own experience will be proportionate to your individual trust and confidence in God”- The Health Food Ministry, page 812, 2nd Paragraph.</p>
